# ClothesCircle

This project was part of my Databases and File Structure course. It was collaborated and completed in the team of 5 poeple. 

Description: 
The “Project Trash” was assigned with a goal to form a company or organization that will do something to help reduce or eliminate the amount of clothes buildup on landfills. 
Our team decided to form a organization under United Nations called “Clothes Circle.” 

Instructions for running the project
Phase III of the project involved creating queries and implementing them on a Web Interface which will help us solve this problem as a whole. For the Web Interface design, we used HTML and Boostrap and we used PHP to connect out SQL queries. 
Below are the steps are taken to initialize and run our queries effectively:  
1.	Transfer all of our .html files and .php files to the clothes circle folder under the htdocs folder which is in the xampp folder. 
2.	Start the xampp control panel and start Apache and MySql.
3.	Open up a web browser.
4.	In the address bar of the web browser we type in http://localhost:8080/clothescircle/index_v3.html
5. The webpage will pop up and we can interact with the webpage.
